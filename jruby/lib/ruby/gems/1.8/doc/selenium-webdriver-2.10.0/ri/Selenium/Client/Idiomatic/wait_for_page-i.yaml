    body: Waits for a new page to load.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Selenium constantly keeps track of new pages loading, and sets a &quot;newPageLoaded&quot; flag when it first notices a page load. Running any other Selenium command after turns the flag to false. Hence, if you want to wait for a page to load, you must wait immediately after a Selenium command that caused a page-load.
