  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Simulates a user releasing a key by sending a native operating system keystroke. This function uses the java.awt.Robot class to send a keystroke; this more accurately simulates typing a key on the keyboard. It does not honor settings from the shiftKeyDown, controlKeyDown, altKeyDown and metaKeyDown commands, and does not target any particular HTML element. To send a keystroke to a particular element, focus on the element first before running this command.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: "'keycode' is an integer keycode number corresponding to a java.awt.event.KeyEvent; note that Java keycodes are NOT the same thing as JavaScript keycodes!"
