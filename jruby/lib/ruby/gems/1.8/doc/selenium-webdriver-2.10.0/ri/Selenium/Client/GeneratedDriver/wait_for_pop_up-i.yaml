    body: Waits for a popup window to appear and load up.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: "'windowID' is the JavaScript window &quot;name&quot; of the window that will appear (not the text of the title bar) If unspecified, or specified as &quot;null&quot;, this command will wait for the first non-top window to appear (don't rely on this if you are working with multiple popups simultaneously). 'timeout' is a timeout in milliseconds, after which the action will return with an error. If this value is not specified, the default Selenium timeout will be used. See the setTimeout() command."
