    body: Kills the running Selenium Server and all browser sessions. After you run this command, you will no longer be able to send commands to the server; you can't remotely start the server once it has been stopped. Normally you should prefer to run the &quot;stop&quot; command, which terminates the current browser session, rather than shutting down the entire server.
