  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Specifies whether Selenium should use the native in-browser implementation of XPath (if any native version is available); if you pass &quot;false&quot; to this function, we will always use our pure-JavaScript xpath library. Using the pure-JS xpath library can improve the consistency of xpath element locators between different browser vendors, but the pure-JS version is much slower than the native implementations.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: "'allow' is boolean, true means we'll prefer to use native XPath; false means we'll only use JS XPath"
