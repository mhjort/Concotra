  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: "This command can also be a useful workaround for bug SEL-339. In some cases, Selenium will be unable to intercept a call to window.open (if the call occurs during or before the &quot;onLoad&quot; event, for example). In those cases, you can force Selenium to notice the open window's name by using the Selenium openWindow command, using an empty (blank) url, like this: openWindow(&quot;&quot;, &quot;myFunnyWindow&quot;)."
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: "'url' is the URL to open, which can be blank 'windowID' is the JavaScript window ID of the window to select"
