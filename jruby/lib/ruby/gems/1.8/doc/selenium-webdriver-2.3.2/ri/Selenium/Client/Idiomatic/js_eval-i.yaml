  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Note that, by default, the snippet will run in the context of the &quot;selenium&quot; object itself, so <tt>this</tt> will refer to the Selenium object. Use <tt>window</tt> to refer to the window of your application, e.g. <tt>window.document.getElementById('foo')</tt> If you need to use a locator to refer to a single element in your application page, you can use <tt>this.browserbot.findElement(&quot;id=foo&quot;)</tt> where &quot;id=foo&quot; is your locator.
