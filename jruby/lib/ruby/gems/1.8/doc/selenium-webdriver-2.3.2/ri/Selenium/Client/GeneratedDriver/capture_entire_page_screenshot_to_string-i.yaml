  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Downloads a screenshot of the browser current window canvas to a based 64 encoded PNG file. The <em>entire</em> windows canvas is captured, including parts rendered outside of the current view port.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Currently this only works in Mozilla and when running in chrome mode.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: "'kwargs' is A kwargs string that modifies the way the screenshot is captured. Example: &quot;background=#CCFFDD&quot;. This may be useful to set for capturing screenshots of less-than-ideal layouts, for example where absolute positioning causes the calculation of the canvas dimension to fail and a black background is exposed (possibly obscuring black text)."
