  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: By default, Selenium's overridden window.confirm() function will return true, as if the user had manually clicked OK; after running this command, the next call to confirm() will return false, as if the user had clicked Cancel. Selenium will then resume using the default behavior for future confirmations, automatically returning true (OK) unless/until you explicitly call this command for each confirmation.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Take note - every time a confirmation comes up, you must consume it with a corresponding getConfirmation, or else the next selenium operation will fail.
