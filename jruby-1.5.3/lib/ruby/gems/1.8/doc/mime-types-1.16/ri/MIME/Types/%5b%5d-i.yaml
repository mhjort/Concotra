  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Returns a list of MIME::Type objects, which may be empty. The optional flag parameters are :complete (finds only complete MIME::Type objects) and :platform (finds only MIME::Types for the current platform). It is possible for multiple matches to be returned for either type (in the example below, 'text/plain' returns two values -- one for the general case, and one for VMS systems.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
    body: "  puts &quot;\\nMIME::Types['text/plain']&quot;\n  MIME::Types['text/plain'].each { |t| puts t.to_a.join(&quot;, &quot;) }\n\n  puts &quot;\\nMIME::Types[/^image/, :complete =&gt; true]&quot;\n  MIME::Types[/^image/, :complete =&gt; true].each do |t|\n    puts t.to_a.join(&quot;, &quot;)\n  end\n"
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: "If multiple type definitions are returned, returns them sorted as follows:"
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
    body: "  1. Complete definitions sort before incomplete ones;\n  2. IANA-registered definitions sort before LTSW-recorded\n     definitions.\n  3. Generic definitions sort before platform-specific ones;\n  4. Current definitions sort before obsolete ones;\n  5. Obsolete definitions with use-instead clauses sort before those\n     without;\n  6. Obsolete definitions use-instead clauses are compared.\n  7. Sort on name.\n"
