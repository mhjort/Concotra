    body: MIME content-types which are not regestered by IANA nor defined in RFCs are required to start with <tt>x-</tt>. This counts as well for a new media type as well as a new sub-type of an existing media type. If either the media-type or the content-type begins with <tt>x-</tt>, this method will return <tt>false</tt>.
