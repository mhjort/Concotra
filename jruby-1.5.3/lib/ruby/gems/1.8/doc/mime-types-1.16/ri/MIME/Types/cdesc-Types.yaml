  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: MIME types are used in MIME-compliant communications, as in e-mail or HTTP traffic, to indicate the type of content which is transmitted. MIME::Types provides the ability for detailed information about MIME entities (provided as a set of MIME::Type objects) to be determined and used programmatically. There are many types defined by RFCs and vendors, so the list is long but not complete; don't hesitate to ask to add additional information. This library follows the IANA collection of MIME types (see below for reference).

    body: MIME types are used in MIME entities, as in email or HTTP traffic. It is useful at times to have information available about MIME types (or, inversely, about files). A MIME::Type stores the known information about one MIME type.
