  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Find the place at which <tt>value</tt> would normally be inserted into the Enumerable. If that place is already occupied by <tt>value</tt>, do nothing and return <tt>nil</tt>. If the place does not exist (i.e., it is off the end of the Enumerable), add it to the end. Otherwise, replace the element at that point with <tt>value</tt>. It is assumed that the Enumerable's values are numeric.
