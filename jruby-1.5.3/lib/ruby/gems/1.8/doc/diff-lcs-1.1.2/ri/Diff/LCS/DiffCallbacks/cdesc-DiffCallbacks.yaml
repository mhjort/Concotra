    body: "This will produce a compound array of simple diff change objects. Each element in the #diffs array is a <tt>hunk</tt> or <tt>hunk</tt> array, where each element in each <tt>hunk</tt> array is a single Change object representing the addition or removal of a single element from one of the two tested sequences. The <tt>hunk</tt> provides the full context for the changes."

    body: There are five hunks here. The first hunk says that the <tt>a</tt> at position 0 of the first sequence should be deleted (<tt>'-'</tt>). The second hunk says that the <tt>d</tt> at position 2 of the second sequence should be inserted (<tt>'+'</tt>). The third hunk says that the <tt>h</tt> at position 4 of the first sequence should be removed and replaced with the <tt>f</tt> from position 4 of the second sequence. The other two hunks are described similarly.
