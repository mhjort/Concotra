    body: Since Ruby is very dynamic, methods added to the ancestors of BlankSlate <em>after BlankSlate is defined</em> will show up in the list of available BlankSlate methods. We handle this by defining a hook in the Object and Kernel classes that will hide any method defined after BlankSlate has been loaded.
