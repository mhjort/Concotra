    body: "Registers a proc that will be wrapped around each scenario. The proc should accept two arguments: two arguments: the scenario and a &quot;block&quot; argument (but passed as a regular argument, since blocks cannot accept blocks in 1.8), on which it should call the .call method. You can register as many as you want (typically from ruby scripts under <tt>support/hooks.rb</tt>)."
