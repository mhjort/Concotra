  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Classes in this module represent the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that gets built when feature files are parsed.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: "AST classes don't expose any internal data directly. This is in order to encourage a less coupled design in the classes that operate on the AST. The only public method is #accept."
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: The AST can be traversed with a visitor. See Cucumber::Format::Pretty for an example.
