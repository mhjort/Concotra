  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Verifies that time elements (hour, minute) exist on the current page with the specified values. You can optionally restrict the search to a specific time's elements by assigning <tt>options[:from]</tt> the value of the time's label. Selects all the time elements with date provided. The time provided may be a string or a Time object.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Rail's convention is used for detecting the time elements. All elements are assumed to have a shared prefix. You may specify the prefix by assigning <tt>options[:id_prefix]</tt>.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: "Note: Just like Rails' time_select helper this assumes the form is using 24 hour select boxes, and not 12 hours with AM/PM."
